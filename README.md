# Summary

With an average of more than 100 fatalities each day, gun violence in the United States has been a major and ongoing problem. Millions of Americans have been trying to make ends meet, making poverty a serious issue at the same time. Our proposed project is analyzing the relationship between poverty and gun violence at the national and state levels, and developing evidence-based policy recommendations to address poverty and gun violence.
